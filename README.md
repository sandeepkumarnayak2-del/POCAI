# POCAI — Enterprise AI Service Desk Agent

POCAI is a proof-of-concept AI service desk agent demonstrating RAG, agent workflows, secure tool execution, authorization, human approval, and production-oriented observability.

## Overview

The application can:

- Answer IT support questions using RAG
- Retrieve information from internal IT documentation
- Create, list, and retrieve service desk tickets
- Require human approval before ticket creation
- Enforce JWT authentication and role-based access
- Enforce object-level ticket authorization
- Protect against basic prompt-injection attempts
- Validate and sanitize user input
- Store application data in PostgreSQL
- Use a Redis-compatible Key Value service for rate limiting and shared state
- Provide health checks, metrics, logging, and audit events

## Technology

- Python
- FastAPI
- LangGraph
- LangChain
- Groq / GPT-OSS
- Chroma
- PostgreSQL
- Redis-compatible Key Value
- JWT
- Docker
- Render
- Prometheus

## Observability

- Health check: `/health`
- Prometheus metrics: `/metrics`
- Structured application logging
- Audit events
- LLM latency and call metrics
- Tool-call metrics

## Security

Authorization is enforced by application code rather than relying on the LLM.

Users can only access tickets they are authorized to view.

Consequential actions require human approval before execution.

Sensitive configuration such as API keys is stored as environment variables and is not committed to the repository.

## Example Workflow

```text
User: My VPN is not working
        |
        v
RAG retrieves relevant IT documentation
        |
        v
User: Create a high-priority ticket
        |
        v
Human approval required
        |
        v
Approved
        |
        v
Ticket created in PostgreSQL
```
